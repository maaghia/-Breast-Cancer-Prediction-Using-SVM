# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-SVM

In this bootcamp, we are going to build a fully-functional Breast Cancer Prediction Model. By the end of this bootcamp, you will have a working model that you can customize and use in your project. The most important part of building a Breast Cancer Prediction Model is to have a solid workflow. We have used Support Vector Machines to build a fully-functional Breast Cancer Prediction Model.

Learn to Build a Breast Cancer Prediction model with a focus on:
1. Fundamentals of Predictive Analysis with a focus on Support Vector Machines.
2. Hands-on session to build a Predictive Analysis Model for Breast Cancer Prediction. You will have a working model at the end of the session.
3. Learn how you can use kandi (pronounced like candy) to tap into millions of open-source assets to build your AI application.
